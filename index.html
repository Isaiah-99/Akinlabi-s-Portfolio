             organizations make better decisions. I also enjoy creating clear and engaging data visualizations with tools like Power BI. I am skilled at organizing and cleaning data, exploring data to find trends, and derive meaningful insight. 
             My aim is to turn data into useful information that can guide important decisions. In my free time, I enjoy reading books and meditating, which keeps me motivated and regurgitate over problems solved and unsolved problems</p>

            <p><b>Data Source: Secondary Data (Kaggle)</b></p>
            <p> <b> Sales Data report Introduction:</b> This Dashboard RT stores is a sales company that deals with selling of varieties of goods like Amarilla, Chocolate pack, Gift basket, men’s Shirt, Velo and VTT across some 
            countries like Canada, France, Mexico, USA, and Germany. Recently, RT faced some challenges in their monthly income and decrease in sales which might eventually lead to laying off staffs and closing the company.
             This is an analysis to discover the problems and give recommendation based on the analysis using MS Excel and Power BI for data visualization. In my findings, It was observed that 118,73m, 101.83 & 18.45m were the Total Sales, Total Cost of Goods Sold and the Profit made respectively; whereby the profit was calculated after deducting the cost of goods sold from the total sales. It was observed using the Trendline and the stacked bar chart, that profit made has experience very low-medium-high trend since the inception of the product sold being bought which is not a good indicator of a profitable business; which indicates the business has been running on losses from 9th of January, 2013 till 12th January, 2013.</p>
